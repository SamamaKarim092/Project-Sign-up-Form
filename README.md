# Project-Sign-up-Form

This is the Sign-Up form Page that I made using HTML, CSS & Javascript.
Things I learned by making this project is
1. How to check and verify between the two input text box ie. Password and Confirm Password
2. The use of required , min , max in term of length of of username.
3. I got better in use of Flexbox.
4. Putting image on to the image.
5. The use of personal made Font.
